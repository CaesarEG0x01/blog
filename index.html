    <h1>Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing</h1>
    <p>Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) are two types of vulnerability testing. The tests have different strengths and are often combined to achieve a more complete vulnerability analysis. In short, Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessments perform two different tasks, usually with different results, within the same area of focus.
<br>
Vulnerability assessment tools discover which vulnerabilities are present, but they do not differentiate between flaws that can be exploited to cause damage and those that cannot. Vulnerability scanners alert companies to the preexisting flaws in their code and where they are located.<br> Penetration tests attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities in a system to determine whether unauthorized access or other malicious activity is possible and identify which flaws pose a threat to the application. Penetration tests find exploitable flaws and measure the severity of each. A penetration test is meant to show how damaging a flaw could be in a real attack rather than find every flaw in a system. Together, penetration testing and vulnerability assessment tools provide a detailed picture of the flaws that exist in an application and the risks associated with those flaws.</p>

    <h1>Web Applications Security Services</h1>
    <p>Web applications are only becoming more relevant. Millions of people depend on web apps to handle their most sensitive information, whether it be for financial planning or medical care. With their growing complexity comes unforeseen security flaws and simple human error. This risk increases as web applications become more interconnected through the linking of APIs. Security researchers find new methods of making these applications bend and break every day.
<br>
The result of web application holes is theft of plenty of credit cards, paramount reputational and financial damage for a lot of enterprises, and also the compromise of several browsing machines that visited those websites which were attacked by hackers. To avoid a scenario like this, web penetration testing maintains complete security and that is the major reason why it holds utmost importance for an organization. Web Application Penetration Testing is designed for detecting security vulnerabilities within the web-based apps.</p>
